# Filter-Bot
 JDA Bot that filters/blacklist certain words

ADDED:
-Can add more words via typing command in discord
-Filter words and delete them in channel

BUGS:
-when a clean message was editted and replaced with words in the filter.txt file. it won't delete

FUTURE ADDITION:
- GUI for the user to use (idk for users who wants to operate a bot without code knowledge?)
- Remove words from the filter.txt file (so you don't need to into directory and change it by yourself)
